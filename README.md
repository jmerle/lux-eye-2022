## Development

This project uses Yarn as package manager. After cloning the repository (or forking and cloning), run `yarn` to install the dependencies and `yarn dev` to run a local development server. `yarn lint` is available to check for code quality and formatting issues, and `yarn fix` can be used to fix most linting issues automatically.
